### Elden Ring Bingo Board Generator

## Configuration

To select how many of each game stage (early, mid, or late) squares you want in your board, simply edit the respective "count" constants of each game stage (ie. earlyCount, midCount...). Remember, each board must add up to a total of 25 squares!

To edit the squares themselves, go into "./src/squares" and into the respective file you want to edit. Remove what you want removed, and follow this specific '{ name: "Square description here!" },' convention to add squares.

## Generate

To generate a bingo board, simple double click the generate.bat batch file, and the board will be automatically generated and copied to your clipboard! Simply paste the content into a new "Game: Custom (Advanced)" room in the "Board" section on bingosync.com and enjoy!
